Even if one can find a school to enroll and provide special education for children affected with Down Syndrome, these schools do not educate them how to perceive their adult life or to seek employment in the society. To bridge the gap between school life to adulthood, and enable them to fully integrate with the general public we need to harvest talents, thereby allowing them to enroll in skilled employment and contribute to the productivity of the society. The primary objective of this project is to create and design a space where young adults affected with Down Syndrome have the opportunity to foster their knowledge and up bring their skills through specialized schooling and training programs. This space would act as a transition facility where young adults with Down Syndrome can enhance their skills and embrace adulthood independently. These skills would enable them to seek open employment and at the same time, providing the opportunity for businesses to integrate this labor into their productivity, thereby contributing to the betterment of the country\'s GDP (Gross Domestic Product).

As a nation that values education, Sri Lanka has an esteemed level of 92% literacy rate in Asia and on average above the world (UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2020). Children between the ages of 5 to 14 have a record high of 95% who attend school. Distressingly of the 10.6% of children who have disabilities, only 0.4% of them attend schools. Significantly 10.2% do not attend school due to their disabilities (UNICEF ROSA, 2007).

According to National Down syndrome society, in every cell in the human body there is a nucleus, where genetic material is stored in genes. Genes carry the codes responsible for all of our inherited traits and are grouped along rod-like structures called chromosomes. Typically, the nucleus of each cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, half of which are inherited from each parent. Down syndrome occurs when an individual has a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21 (NDSS, 2020).
        <br/>
It’s the bitter truth that people with Down Syndrome are not always fully accepted by our society. Even though differently abled is now the phrase we use, it\'s been limited to a new word in our vocabulary and the prejudice continues. When there is injustice there is always a counter force, this can be within the community or external. Some exceptional individuals with Down Syndrome, but have literally brought the phrasing “differently abled” into life are, Ángela Bachiller (Politician), Jamie Brewer (Actor) Marte Wexelsen Goksøyr (Public speaker) Diand Madeline Stuart (Supermodel) (Griffin, S. 2019). These are just a few who broke through barriers and the unharvested talents are still at large within the community, especially in developing countries such as Sri Lanka. It\'s the polite rejection from the greater society that we need to change, and let them fully integrate, bringing in their contribution to the country. Also, at the same time allowing them to endure their adult life independently. ',

Many public schools currently in Sri Lanka do not publicly discriminate against students with learning difficulties, but as a developing country Sri Lankan schools lack the resources required by such students. For instance, the pupil-teacher ratio is currently 22.93 and this deteriorates when you take the rural parts of the island (UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2020), thereby these public schools don\'t offer Down Syndrome students, with the time and dedication they require to excel their learning difficulties. A specialized school and training center that is equipped with adequate resources is a necessity to cater to such students. The primary goal of this Centre is to create a space that provides students with Down syndrome and address their special needs through well planned, natural lighting, comfort and sensory spaces. The space will directly help them to enhance their skills in order to adopt with the general society and seek skilled employment. This space will be driven with modern technology and at the same time employee professionals to train them with social aspects. Being employed helps an individual with Down syndrome to gain confidence and develop self-esteem.  Also, this acts as a platform for these very capable individuals to showcase their talents and to spread awareness by integration with the greater society (Cicerchia, M. 2020).

Thus, enabling them to adopt easily with the general public. The idea was brought into life by caregivers, as they were worried if the need did arise, Down syndrome adults would not be able to live independently without depending on others (Rashith, R. 2019).
<br/>
The space can accommodate up to 24 young adults and consists of training rooms, family discussion room, separate space for infants and toddlers and a pantry.  These specialized areas aim to help young adults with Down syndrome to develop skills that will help them to live independently in their daily life and train them in homely realistic surroundings. 
<br/>
The main skills they intend to develop are decision making & time management, personal safety & hygiene, financial planning & economics, communal living and independent travelling. (Rashith, R. 2019).  According to Mr. Alvin Ho the assistant director of the charity, the ultimate goal for the Centre is to partner up with local service groups and organizations within the community to provide employment or carry out collaborative projects.
<br/>
The facility enrolls students over the age of 18 with Down syndrome. In a Statement Mr. Sam Tan (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Social and Family Development) mentioned that the private sector should continue to work closely with initiatives such as this Centre. Thereby providing equal opportunities for capable young adults with Down syndrome to seek employment and contribute to national workforce and productivity.

A separate young adult division carries out habilitation programs to employment services. The Summit Center is devoted to enhancing your adult life wherever it may take you. Not only does the center help you find employment, but helps you maintain and overcome barriers that you may face during work. A specialist from the Centre will initially identify your skills and areas of interest. For example, if you are interested in art, they may try to find you a placement at an arts & crafts store. Once this is established the assigned specialist will work towards applying for jobs, scheduling interviews, and if needed provide on the job training to ensure that you adopt to your new work environment. They look into other social aspects of work from packing your lunch to making new friends at your job (The Summit Center, 2020).

This training Centre is subdivided into specialized serving units such as Bradbury parents resource Centre, Jockey Club Down syndrome Centre, Tiptop Training Centre and Employment Services Centre. Each division catering to each and every need of an individual or their families affected from Down syndrome.

Jockey Club Down syndrome Centre is the only service Centre in Hong Kong catering to individuals with Down syndrome (The Hong Kong Down Syndrome Association, 2019). The primary goal in this Centre is to harvest and unleash their talents, develop self-reliance, motivate, adopt a healthy lifestyle and be more independent. The above is achieved through professional teachings and training. In comparison to spaces in Hong Kong this facility covers an extensive 1620 square feet and contains music rooms, multipurpose meeting areas and a professional dance studio. When these rooms are not occupied, they are available on rent basis for outsiders in order to generate extra income for the non-profit organization (The Hong Kong Down Syndrome Association, 2019).

Furthermore, it acts as a safety net for students who have fallbacks, giving them another chance to get re-trained before they seek employment again. The name Tiptop Training Centre was chosen to demonstrate the idea of operating the Centre in “tip-top” manner. (The Hong Kong Down Syndrome Association, 2019). In this facility they accommodate individuals aged 15 or above and they undergo training, social skills development, talent enhancement and followed up with job placement and on-the-job training. Also, local businesses have the ability to outsource certain work to the sheltered workshop such as packaging, posting, stationary work, arts & crafts, car, homes and office cleaning services.

Employment Service Centre provides systematic and on job training, counselling, negotiation of remuneration packages and special working conditions and follow up services to individuals with Down syndrome. This Centre mainly focuses on further increasing their work potential, developing competitiveness at work and ease the adaptation to the work environment. The core objective is here to provide a productive member to the employer and at the same time ensure the employee adopts smoothly to the new work environment. The adoption process is crucial for a person with Down syndrome as a bad experience, such as over pressure might leave the individual with a negative mental impact.

They firmly believe that “America is safer and stronger when people can live healthy and productive lives and when nations around the world are self-reliant and can prevent and withstand crisis” (USAID, 2020). Under the Global Health outreach, they have categorically supported advancing disability-inclusive development. USAID considers that over 1 billion people in the world or close to 15% of the population in the world suffer from some form of disability. Out of the above-mentioned percentage, 8% of the population live in developing countries in Africa and Asia (USAID, 2020). Further it’s expected that these numbers will see an increase due to ageing population and diminishing health conditions in these regions. In a statement USAID said that individuals with disabilities tend to experience poverty when compared to others.

They also believe people with disabilities are excluded. Especially in relation to the overall global advancement and they have taken upon them to make sure these individuals with disabilities such as Down syndrome have equal opportunities to contribute to the global development. In their commitment to help individuals with disabilities, they have developed an approach named “twin tracked”. This is where USAID supports disability relation programs around the world and they also integrate disabled persons into such initiatives.  This is mainly due to legal, social and economic reasons to include individuals with disabilities in USAID programs globally. For instance, in the United States and some European countries, to discriminate against any individual with any form of disability. USAID strongly believes that disability rights are equal to human rights, excluding one on the grounds of being disable is not only discrimination but a loss for the country and for the global economy (USAID, 2020).
