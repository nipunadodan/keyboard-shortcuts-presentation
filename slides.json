    "desc2":"In relation to the research conducted, it is proposed to establish a Transition Centre for young adults with Down Syndrome. Even if one can find a school to enroll and provide special education for children affected with Down Syndrome, these schools do not educate them how to perceive their adult life or to seek employment in the society. To bridge the gap between school life to adulthood and enable them to fully integrate with the general public we need to harvest talents, thereby allowing them to enroll in skilled employment and contribute to the productivity of the society. The primary objective of this project is to create and design a space where young adults affected with Down Syndrome have the opportunity to foster their knowledge and up bring their skills through specialized schooling and training programs. This space would act as a transition facility where young adults with Down Syndrome can enhance their skills and embrace adulthood independently. These skills would enable them to seek open employment and at the same time, providing the opportunity for businesses to integrate this labor into their productivity, thereby contributing to the betterment of the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product).\n        <br\/>\nSri Lanka is a country that values education, and it has an esteemed level of 92% literacy rate in Asia and on average above the world (UNESCO UIS, 2020). Children between the ages of 5 to 14 have a record high of 95% who attend school. Distressingly of the 10.6% of children who have disabilities, only 0.4% of them attend schools. Significantly 10.2% do not attend school due to their disabilities. (UNICEF ROSA, 2007).\n.",

    "desc2":"According to the Department census and statistics 343,689 people suffer cognitive disabilities in Sri Lanka (Department of Census and Statistics, 2020), in relation to that 36% suffer with Down Syndrome (Muttiah, Drager and Connor, 2020). It can be defined as genetic disorder that results when an individual is born with an extra copy of the 21st chromosome. It comes with characteristic physical and mental traits such as distinct facial features and short stature and babies may need health interventions including surgeries to address heart, hearing or eyesight issues (Cicerchia, 2020).\n        <br\/>\nIt\u2019s the bitter truth that people suffering from Down Syndrome are not always fully accepted by our society. Even though differently abled is now the phrase we use, it's been limited to a new word in our vocabulary and the prejudice continues. When there is injustice there is always a counter force, this can be within the community or external. Some exceptional individuals with Down Syndrome, but have literally brought the phrasing \u201cdifferently abled\u201d into life are, \u00c1ngela Bachiller (Politician), Jamie Brewer (Actor) Marte Wexelsen Goks\u00f8yr (Public speaker) Diand Madeline Stuart (Supermodel) (Griffin, 2020). These are just a few who broke through barriers and the unharvested talents are still at large within the community, especially in developing countries such as Sri Lanka. It's the polite rejection from the greater society that we need to change, and let them fully integrate, bringing in their contribution to the country. Also, at the same time allowing them to endure their adult life independently.",

    "desc2":"It is important to allocate resources and opportunities to people with learning difficulties, the same as people without. Many public schools currently in Sri Lanka do not publicly discriminate against students with learning difficulties, but as a developing country Sri Lankan schools lack the resources required by such students. For instance, the pupil-teacher ratio is currently 22.93 and this deteriorates when you take the rural parts of the island (UNESCO UIS, 2020)., thereby these public schools don't offer Down Syndrome students, with the time and dedication they require to excel their learning difficulties. A specialized school and training center that is equipped with adequate resources is a necessity to cater to such students. The primary goal of this Centre is to create a space that provides students with Down syndrome and address their special needs through well planned, natural lighting, comfort and sensory spaces. The space will directly help them to enhance their skills in order to adopt with the general society and seek skilled employment. This space will be driven with modern technology and at the same time employee professionals to train them with social aspects. Having a job builds confidence and self-esteem for people with Down syndrome, whether it is a paid or volunteer position. It\u2019s also a good way to increase awareness of learning difficulties among the general public, especially when it comes to showing the many talents these very capable and special individuals possess (Cicerchia , 2020)\n        <br\/>\n        Understanding and analyzing similar facilities helping young adults with Down syndrome or other disabilities is vital for the success of this project. Below are three similar spaces located in different parts of the world, established to provide similar services for the betterment of young adults with Down Syndrome.",

The idea was brought into life by caregivers, as they were worried if the need did arise, Down syndrome adults would not be able to live independently without depending on others.\n<br\/>\nThe space can accommodate up to 24 young adults and consists of practice rooms, a kitchen, infant toddler room and a family room. These specialized areas aim to help young adults with Down syndrome to develop daily living skills and practice them in homely realistic surroundings.

F. Kennedy in 1961, leads the US governments and people\u2019s international developments and humanitarian efforts. Primary goal of USAID has been to help lift lives in poverty, build communities and advance democracy in countries in need. $39.3 billion was allocated in the financial year of 2019 to carry out humanitarian initiatives in over 100 countries across the globe. These efforts can be vastly seen in Africa, Asia, Europe, Eurasia, Latin American, the Caribbean and Middle East. In accordance with the U.S foreign policy the primary budget is divided into empower women, promote global health, support global stability, provide humanitarian assistance and catalyze innovation and partnership. The Global Health arm has been operational over 50 years, the USAID\u2019s global health programs have prevented crisis, saved lives and promoted stability from deadly diseases around the world.

    "desc2":"Under the Global Health outreach, they have categorically supported advancing disability-inclusive development. USAID considers that over 1 billion people in the world or close to 15 percent of the population in the world suffer from some form of disability. Out of the above-mentioned percentage, 8 percent of the population live in developing countries in Africa and Asia. further it\u2019s expected that these numbers will see an increase due to ageing population and diminishing health conditions in these regions. In a statement USAID said that, Persons with disabilities are more likely to experience poverty. They are also less likely to access basic services because of stigma, discrimination and inaccessibility. The lack of access to vital services and programs contributes to their marginalization and exclusion, with little or no option to escape from poverty.\n<br\/>\nThey also believe that persons with disabilities remain invisible. Especially in the overall global development agenda and they have taken upon them to ensure that people with disabilities such as Down syndrome have equal opportunities to contribute to the global advancement. In their commitment to help individuals with disabilities, they have developed an approach named \u201ctwin tracked\u201d, this is where they support disability-specific programs to address targeted needs, and they seek to integrate disability into all our programs. This is mainly due to legal, social and economic reasons to include individuals with disabilities in USAID programs globally. For instance, its illegal in many countries including in the US, to discriminate against any individual with any form of disability. USAID strongly believes that disability rights are equal to human rights, excluding one on the grounds of being disable is not only discrimination but a loss for the country and for the global economy.\n",

This justifies the fact that there is a questionable issue in the educational approach currently deployed for students with any form of disabilities. The first Centre of Down Syndrome children and young adults was established in 2016 in Singapore, which states that Sri Lanka being an Asian country, it's not too late. It\u2019s important to consider the fact that young adults enrolling, will have no or little knowledge and training taking into account that only 0.4% enrolls in schooling. This would make the operations at the Centre twice as more challenging but at the same time justifies the necessity of a Transition Centre for young adults with Down syndrome. The primary goals that we intend to achieve via the Centre, is to ensure that individuals enrolling will leave as independent young adults, ready for employment or employed, will be socially sound, allowing them to fully integrate with the general public. This space will conduct specialized training and teaching programs in relation with modern technology to foster their knowledge and enhance their skills. These skills will benefit the persons enrolling with the Centre and at the same time benefit many other stakeholders such as, Families of these independent young adults will require to invest less time and money on them, businesses will have access to a brand new source of labor and lastly these individuals will contribute towards the country as whereas before they were a burden to the country. Once the Centre is established and success is proven it would be ideal to open similar places, covering the major districts in the island. Health programs funded by the USAID have always been encouraged for expansion when proven successful, further we can seek help and donations from the local government and other entities. The success of this initiative will be judged by the output of an employed, independent, and social young adult with Down syndrome, and not by the kind of work undertaken by people with Down syndrome as it varies from person to person. Some can work in restaurants; others may bag groceries at the supermarket or answer phones at an office. There are celebrated artists with the condition, including painters, singers, dancers and musicians.
